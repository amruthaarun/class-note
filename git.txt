git2

In small team of two-persons, we can create git repository on a machine in our network. and designate it as central repository.
both co-developers creates copy of central repository
both can commit code to local repository

* git init --bare -> to create a bare repository

ther is 3 folders
eg:
	proj-server (central repository)
	proj-dev1 (co-developer1)
	proj-dev2 (co-developer1)

* git clone proj-server proj-dev1  -> to create copy of central repository

* git push origin master -> to push changes in local repository to central repository

when co-developer2 push change after co-developer1 pushed, it cause som error.

this is because developer1 has pushed some changes. if developer2 wants to push her changes, she has to fetch and merge the content of central repository to her local repository

* git fetch origin

* git merge origin/master

then 
git push origin master


github.mp4
----------


need to create ssh key on our machine. then copy it to git hub account
command is  

*  ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "hello@gmail.com"

now ssh-keygen is created folder .ssh

there is 2 files under this folder.
then  open id_rsa.pub in vi and coy the content to github account then  enter

after that execute ssh -T git@github.com in terminal.
 then create repository in github

* push the content of local repo to remote github account by
git remote add origin git@github.com:amruthaarun/test.git

origin is a shortcut notation

git push -u origin master
